<h1>1. Executive Summary</h1>
<div class="purpose">Here is who we are, what we have built, and what we need. Read this section and you will know if the rest is worth your time.</div>

<p><strong>Umay built the first at-home ocular recovery platform that eye doctors actually prescribe and reorder.</strong> Co-founded by Ali Habib (engineering, product) and Dr. Sharmin Habib, OD (clinical direction, claims integrity), the company sits at a rare overlap: a real clinical problem, a purpose-built device clinics already sell through, and the discipline to scale without overclaiming.</p>

<h3>Traction snapshot (February 2026)</h3>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="metric">Units shipped</td><td>~3,000 to 107 clinic partners (42 actively ordering)</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Lifetime revenue</td><td>$1.5M+</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">TTM revenue</td><td>$620K (supply-constrained &mdash; not a demand ceiling)</td></tr>

    <tr><td class="metric">Return rate</td><td>Below 1% across all units shipped</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Daily usage (pilot, N=500)</td><td>84% &middot; DAU/MAU 0.64 across 2,847 active IoT devices</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Why is TTM revenue only $620K?</strong> Because Umay ran out of inventory. When product was in stock, the company hit a $300K single-quarter pace. <strong>1,600 pre-ordered units sit waiting with deposits already collected.</strong> This is a supply problem, not a demand problem. The single highest-ROI use of new capital is putting product on shelves.</p>

<h3>The invisible fatigue insight</h3>
<p>Most people do not realize how tired their eyes are. They adapt, push through, and normalize the strain &mdash; until it shows up as bad sleep, lost focus, and lower daily output. <strong>Clinics can name this invisible problem, prescribe a simple recovery ritual, and watch patients come back for more.</strong> That loop &mdash; name it, prescribe it, see the reorder &mdash; is the engine behind everything Umay does.</p>

<h3>Product and regulatory posture</h3>
<p><strong>Umay Rest</strong> is a consumer wellness device: <strong>Health Canada consumer safety approved, IEC 60335-1 certified.</strong> The company uses a four-tier claims ladder with a five-gate evidence system. In plain terms: we say only what the evidence supports, we track what we are allowed to say, and we have a formal process to unlock stronger claims as evidence grows (see Appendix A). This protects regulatory flexibility and keeps trust with ODs intact.</p>

<p><strong>RestScan</strong> is a browser-based, webcam-powered ocular fatigue and stress assessment tool in development. It runs 100% locally &mdash; no video stored, no facial data transmitted. It will add measurement and personalization to the clinic visit, but <strong>it is not required for near-term growth.</strong> Target: clinic-ready ~12 months post-close (see Appendix F for privacy architecture, Appendix O for roadmap).</p>

<h3>Three strategic layers</h3>
<div class="thesis">
  <strong>1. Today &mdash; Ocular Recovery Platform:</strong> Clinically informed, at-home recovery for dry eye symptoms, digital strain, and ocular fatigue. Clinics prescribe it. Patients use it. Both buy again.<br><br>
  <strong>2. Next &mdash; Closed-Loop Measurement (~12 months post-close):</strong> RestScan adds an objective signal to the clinic visit &mdash; turning a subjective recommendation into a data-backed prescription moment.<br><br>
  <strong>3. Future &mdash; Autonomic Recovery / Neuro-Ocular Health:</strong> Pursued only when evidence and adoption justify it. Not a distraction; a gated option.
</div>

<p><strong>Roadmap in one line:</strong> Scale the clinic-led platform first. Introduce RestScan after clinical validation. Extend into autonomic health only when the data earns it.</p>

<h3>The thesis in one sentence</h3>
<div class="thesis">
  <strong>Umay built a clinically backed ocular recovery platform that clinics already reorder, and is layering in closed-loop measurement to deepen conversion, adherence, and defensibility &mdash; while keeping claims discipline tight enough to preserve full regulatory flexibility.</strong>
</div>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 2. STRATEGIC THESIS & CATEGORY POSITIONING -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>2. Strategic Thesis and Category Positioning</h1>
<div class="purpose">Why does this category exist, and why is Umay the one to own it? The answer shapes how investors should size the opportunity.</div>

<p><strong>Umay&rsquo;s strategy starts from the most credible edge: optometric clinical authority paired with a product that already works in market.</strong> The company does not &ldquo;sell wellness into clinics.&rdquo; It <strong>exports clinical credibility into wellness</strong> &mdash; using clinics as the trust engine, then widening access as logistics and capacity catch up.</p>

<p>The foundational insight: <strong>invisible ocular fatigue.</strong> Patients cannot accurately gauge how strained their eyes are. The damage shows up indirectly &mdash; worse sleep, less focus, lower output. Clinics are not just buying a device. They are buying a structured answer to a problem that has never had measurable feedback before. This insight drives product design, clinic adoption, and the entire platform expansion path.</p>

<h2>2.1 Category Framing</h2>
<p>Category clarity matters because <strong>it changes how investors size the opportunity.</strong> Umay should be read as two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ocular Recovery Platform (primary):</strong> Rest is an at-home recovery system for eye comfort and relaxation. It fits into a habit window patients already have (10 minutes before bed), which drives high adherence and low returns. Clinics are repeatable distribution nodes &mdash; one relationship, many patient conversions (see Appendix K).</li>
  <li><strong>Closed-Loop Measurement (architectural layer):</strong> RestScan adds an objective measure at the start of the care journey. It turns a subjective &ldquo;your eyes seem dry&rdquo; into a data-backed prescription moment &mdash; without claiming diagnosis. This strengthens conversion, reinforces adherence, and builds a compounding data asset (see Appendix O).</li>
</ul>
<p>Category framing drives the execution roadmap (see Section 7).</p>

<h2>2.2 Tone: Quietly Confident, Clinically Grounded</h2>
<p>Umay is positioned as <strong>clinically adjacent wellness:</strong> OD-led, science-backed, compliance-aware. Ambition shows up in defensible execution &mdash; patents, reorder data, clinic adoption &mdash; not hype. Rest is proven. RestScan is being built. Neither requires the other to work, but together they create a loop no competitor has. (See Appendix A for the claims governance tiers, gates, and enforcement triggers.)</p>

<h2>2.3 The Thesis in One Sentence</h2>
<div class="thesis">
  Umay built a clinically backed ocular recovery platform that clinics already reorder. It is layering in closed-loop measurement to deepen conversion, adherence, and defensibility &mdash; while keeping claims discipline tight enough to preserve full regulatory flexibility.
</div>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 3. ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNANCE -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>3. Organization and Governance</h1>
<div class="purpose">Who runs this company, and is it built to survive its founders? Yes &mdash; with a clear plan to scale beyond founder bandwidth.</div>

<p><strong>Umay is founder-led at an inflection point.</strong> Everything to date &mdash; ~3,000 units shipped, 107 clinic partners, $1.5M+ lifetime revenue, government-backed pilot data &mdash; was built by <strong>3 people plus one hardware contractor.</strong> That capital efficiency is an asset. But it also means Ali currently spans sales, manufacturing, ops, product, and fundraising. The post-raise plan fixes this.</p>

<h3>Founder dynamic</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ali Habib (CEO):</strong> Leads product architecture and commercial execution. Post-raise, Ali shifts to the work only Ali can do &mdash; investors, partnerships, top accounts, category vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Dr. Sharmin Habib, OD (CMO):</strong> Governs clinical direction and claims integrity. Anchors optometric credibility. Protects regulatory posture through evidence discipline.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The origin story is clinical, not tech-first.</strong> The product exists because dry eye care had a real gap &mdash; not because someone wanted to &ldquo;find a market for a gadget.&rdquo; The same pattern drives RestScan: clinics lack an accessible way to measure ocular fatigue at the point of care. (See Appendix O for the origin narrative.)</p>
<p>Founder execution follows the same staged roadmap laid out in Section 7.</p>

<h3>Governance maturity</h3>
<p>Umay treats governance as a system, not a founder trait. Claims governance, privacy architecture, and regulatory pathway planning are <strong>built into the operating model &mdash; not retrofits.</strong> Post-raise additions: board-ready governance structure and D&amp;O insurance (see Appendix I).</p>

<div class="objection">
  <strong>Anticipating the objection:</strong> <em>&ldquo;A 3-person team is a single-point-of-failure risk.&rdquo;</em> Agreed. That is exactly why the first three hires remove founder bottlenecks (see Section 10 and Appendix N). The team is small by design until capital arrives &mdash; not because the company does not know how to hire.
</div>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 4. MARKET AND INDUSTRY CONTEXT -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>4. Market and Industry Context</h1>
<div class="purpose">The problem is massive, growing, and poorly served. Here is the data to prove it.</div>

<p>Umay sits inside <strong>ocular surface health and dry eye disease (DED)</strong> &mdash; a market where demand is high, patients quit treatment fast, and no consumer-grade solution has cracked the adherence problem.</p>

<h3>Market size</h3>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Market Segment</th><th>Size</th><th>Growth</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>US DED therapeutics</td><td>$5.06B (2025)</td><td>8.39% CAGR</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Canadian DED market</td><td>$448M</td><td>9.17% CAGR (fastest in NA)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Treatment devices segment</td><td>$124M (2024)</td><td>&rarr; $261M (2034)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>US societal burden of DED</td><td>$59B/year</td><td>($55B in lost productivity)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Canadian per-patient cost</td><td>C$24,330/year</td><td>79% driven by presenteeism</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Clinics already spend heavily on in-office dry eye procedures</strong> (LipiFlow at $30&ndash;50K per console, TearCare at $15&ndash;25K + $1,200/procedure consumable, IPL at $80&ndash;150K+). These generate revenue but eat chair time, capital, and staff training. <strong>Umay complements all of them as the at-home maintenance layer: zero chair time, zero capital, zero consumables.</strong> A simple prescription motion.</p>

<p>The go-to-market logic is straightforward: optometry clinics are distribution nodes with repeated patient traffic. A single activated clinic can repeatedly convert patients at minimal incremental cost, producing recurring reorder patterns that look more like installed-base retention than one-time hardware sales. (See Appendix K.)</p>

<h2>4.1 Why &ldquo;Clinically-Adjacent Wellness&rdquo; is the Right Investor Category</h2>
<p>This positioning is not marketing copy. It is the <strong>operating posture that protects trust with ODs, keeps claims disciplined, and lets Umay grow distribution without taking on regulatory debt.</strong> Umay is not a consumer gadget, a sleep brand, or a lifestyle product. It leads with clinical credibility. Sleep, fatigue, and productivity are downstream benefits &mdash; real but kept in their lane. (See Appendix A for the claims ladder and prohibited-claim triggers.)</p>

<h2>4.2 The Compliance Crisis Umay Solves</h2>
<div class="purpose">The DED market&rsquo;s structural weakness is adherence. Patients quit. Umay&rsquo;s patients do not.</div>

<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Modality</th><th>Adherence Rate</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Rx eye drops (correct frequency)</td><td>10.2%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Cyclosporine (PDC &ge;80%)</td><td>5.9%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lifitegrast</td><td>9.7%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Treatment discontinuation within 90 days</td><td>&gt;75% quit</td></tr>
    <tr><td>At-home warm compress compliance</td><td>&lt;50%</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Umay Rest daily usage (N=500 pilot)</td><td class="highlight">84%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>That is an order-of-magnitude improvement.</strong> Patients use Umay because the experience feels good immediately &mdash; warm, soothing, 10 minutes before bed. No complex behavior change required. This adherence advantage is the economic engine behind clinic reorder behavior: <strong>patients who actually use a product give clinicians the confidence to prescribe again.</strong></p>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 5. CUSTOMER AND CHANNEL INSIGHTS -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>5. Customer and Channel Insights</h1>
<div class="purpose">Clinics are the trust engine. Here is how the sales motion works and why patients stick.</div>

<h2>5.1 The Clinic as the Trust Engine</h2>
<p>The buyer is the clinic (OD + staff). The end user is the patient. <strong>For a clinic to prescribe repeatedly, three things must be true:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The motion is simple</strong> and does not eat chair time.</li>
  <li><strong>The economics work</strong> relative to other things the clinic sells.</li>
  <li><strong>Patients actually use it</strong> and report benefits &mdash; giving the clinician confidence to prescribe again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Umay&rsquo;s clinic motion meets all three in <strong>under two minutes of staff time</strong> with a zero-inventory option (see Appendix K for scripts and operational design).</p>

<h3>Clinic economics</h3>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="metric">Wholesale price</td><td>$285 CAD</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Clinic retail price</td><td>$500&ndash;$600 CAD (43&ndash;52% margin)</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Avg. practice revenue</td><td>~$2.1M (54% from product sales)</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">DED-focused practice growth</td><td>4&times; industry average</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Annual DED patient value</td><td>$1,700&ndash;$5,300</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Umay adoption friction</td><td>Zero capital, zero consumables, zero chair time</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Reorder behavior is the most honest metric Umay tracks.</strong> A reorder captures patient usage, clinic economics, and trust &mdash; all in one observable action. When a clinic reorders, it means the system is working at every level.</p>

<h2>5.2 Patient Behavior: Adherence and the &ldquo;Felt Experience&rdquo; Advantage</h2>
<p>Traditional dry eye treatments fail because patients quit. Umay&rsquo;s evidence tells a different story: <strong>84% daily usage (government-backed pilot, N=500),</strong> DAU/MAU of 0.64 across 2,847 active IoT devices, and a <strong>return rate below 1%</strong> across ~3,000 units shipped.</p>
<p>The behavioral explanation matters: thermal therapy delivers an <strong>immediate sensory reward.</strong> It slots into a bedtime ritual. It offers dual motivation (eye comfort + better sleep) without asking patients to change complex habits. People stick with things that feel good right away.</p>

<h2>5.3 The Invisible Fatigue Problem (Human Narrative)</h2>
<p>Ocular fatigue hides. People adapt, push through, and keep going until the strain shows up somewhere else &mdash; bad sleep, headaches, foggy thinking. <strong>That is why a clinic-anchored prescription moment matters: it gives language to a silent problem, legitimizes the solution, and creates a ritual patients will actually repeat.</strong> When a clinic moves a patient from vague discomfort to an understood recovery practice, adherence rises, outcomes feel real, and reorders follow.</p>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 6. DEFENSIBILITY AND COMPETITIVE MOAT -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>6. Defensibility and Competitive Moat</h1>
<div class="purpose">Why can&rsquo;t someone else just copy this? Four layers of defense, each reinforcing the others.</div>

<p><strong>Umay&rsquo;s moat is multi-layered.</strong> IP, measurement capability, and clinical credibility all matter. But they ultimately show up in one hard signal: <strong>clinics come back and buy again.</strong> That reorder behavior is the compounding output of every other moat layer.</p>

<h2>6.1 Moat Layer 1: Channel Trust + Reorder Economics (Primary)</h2>
<p>A clinic that has prescribed Umay successfully to dozens of patients has embedded it into their standard of care. Switching costs are <strong>practical and reputational:</strong> clinicians do not drop a product that delivers patient satisfaction and margin for something unproven. Reorders also reduce reliance on constant new-clinic acquisition &mdash; growth shifts to <strong>installed-base expansion.</strong></p>
<p>Of Umay&rsquo;s 42 actively ordering clinics, <strong>~8 Super-Clinics drive roughly 80% of volume,</strong> each moving 5&ndash;10 units per month. This power-law distribution mirrors successful clinic-dispensed product platforms. The 65 dormant clinics in the network represent untapped activation potential.</p>

<h2>6.2 Moat Layer 2: Closed-Loop Measurement (Amplifier)</h2>
<p><strong>RestScan is the strategic amplifier once clinic-ready (~12 months post-close).</strong> It shifts the recommendation from a subjective complaint to an objective wellness signal &mdash; without claiming diagnosis. The core business does not depend on it. It accelerates conversion, adherence, and reorder once validated.</p>

<h3>Closed-loop precedents that validate this architecture</h3>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Company</th><th>Model</th><th>Result</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="metric">Medtronic</td><td>CGM + insulin pump</td><td>$2.76B revenue, 80%+ recurring</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Oura</td><td>Ring + app + subscription</td><td>88% retention (vs. 25% baseline)</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">ForeseeHome</td><td>AMD home monitoring</td><td>Adherence: 62% &rarr; 94%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The universal pattern: <strong>closing the measurement loop drives a 1.5&ndash;3.5&times; retention improvement.</strong> Umay is the only company building this loop for ocular recovery.</p>

<h2>6.3 Moat Layer 3: IP Portfolio</h2>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>IP Type</th><th>Detail</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="metric">US utility patents</td><td>3 issued (incl. Nov 2025 stress-sensing grant)</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">European patent</td><td>1 issued</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Design registrations</td><td>4+</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Trademarks</td><td>5 registered</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Provisionals</td><td>RestScan + Thermal Rhythm</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Estimated replacement cost</td><td>$1.5M&ndash;$3.5M CAD</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>All IP is assigned to the company. Core algorithmic layers (quality gating, fusion scoring) are held as trade secrets. The portfolio protects the <strong>detect &rarr; treat &rarr; measure loop</strong> that a competitor would need to replicate. (See Appendices H and L.)</p>

<h2>6.4 Moat Layer 4: Regulatory Cleanliness as Strategic Leverage</h2>
<p><strong>Regulatory discipline is itself a moat.</strong> Companies that overclaim early build up regulatory debt &mdash; expensive and irreversible. Umay&rsquo;s tiered claims ladder, gate system, and partner compliance provisions scale beyond founder oversight without risking enforcement. (See Appendices A and K.)</p>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 7. REVENUE ENGINE ARCHITECTURE -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>7. Revenue Engine Architecture</h1>
<div class="purpose">How does Umay make money today, and how does it grow? Clinic-led first, DTC second, each gated by operational readiness.</div>

<p>The revenue engine is staged on purpose: <strong>clinic channel first, then broader distribution as logistics and capacity catch up.</strong> Clinics stay strategically central regardless of when DTC comes online &mdash; they are the credibility and conversion engine.</p>
<p><strong>The 2026 execution sequence:</strong> (1) Scale the ocular recovery platform through clinic-led expansion. (2) Introduce closed-loop measurement via RestScan once validated. (3) Explore autonomic health extension only after the data earns it.</p>

<h2>7.1 Stage 1: Clinic-Led Growth and Installed-Base Expansion</h2>
<p>Near-term, clinic-driven growth dominates because it matches Umay&rsquo;s positioning: clinical credibility first. One clinic relationship generates many patient conversions at low incremental cost.</p>

<p><strong>The internal North Star is reorder behavior.</strong> Reorder dominance proves installed-base expansion, which proves the revenue engine compounds.</p>

<h2>7.2 Monetization Models</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wholesale stock-and-sell:</strong> Clinic holds inventory. 43&ndash;52% clinic gross margin. Simple economics.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero-inventory QR prescription flow (drop-ship):</strong> Lower margin but zero risk for the clinic. Scales as US 3PL goes live.</li>
  <li><strong>In-office session billing:</strong> Clinics charge for education/protocol sessions; Rest becomes the at-home maintenance layer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7.3 Stage 2: DTC (Parallel, Gated)</h2>
<p><strong>DTC activates only after US logistics meet clinic-grade service levels</strong> (delivery within ~14 days, moving toward 2-day US delivery; clean returns process; no duty friction). This is an operational gate, not a marketing choice. DTC economics are modeled separately: $705 MSRP, different return profile, direct marketing costs, no clinic margin share. <strong>DTC enters the model as a gated toggle in the bull case.</strong> Clinics remain the primary engine regardless.</p>

<h2>7.4 Salesforce Architecture</h2>
<p>US expansion uses a <strong>managed 1099 rep network</strong> rather than a premature fixed-cost W-2 sales org. This preserves cash while leveraging reps&rsquo; existing ophthalmic relationships. The <strong>Head of Growth role is non-negotiable &mdash;</strong> reps do not replace a leader who owns strategy, pipeline, and clinic activation cadence. (See Appendix K for commission model and rep economics.)</p>

<!-- 8. INSTITUTIONAL READINESS -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>8. Institutional Readiness</h1>
<div class="purpose">Regulatory, privacy, insurance, and legal &mdash; are the foundations solid? Yes. Here is the proof.</div>

<h2>8.1 Claims Governance</h2>
<p>Regulatory discipline protects the staged roadmap: we scale what is proven, and introduce new claims only when evidence supports them (see Section 7).</p>
<p><strong>Umay&rsquo;s claims governance is an operating system, not a document on a shelf.</strong> Four-tier claims ladder. Five-gate evidence graduation. Partner compliance language that scales beyond founder oversight. In practice: Tier 1 claims (market size, general comfort language) can be used freely. Tier 2 claims (pilot outcomes: 87% eye comfort, 70% sleep improvement) require the &ldquo;government-backed pilot, manuscript in draft&rdquo; caveat. Tiers 3 and 4 are locked behind peer review and regulatory clearance. (See Appendix A.)</p>

<h2>8.2 Data Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>RestScan is privacy-first by architecture.</strong> Processing happens locally in the browser. No video stored. No facial identifiers or landmarks transmitted. Rest device telemetry is limited to anonymized usage metadata (session duration, mode, temperature). Customer PII is standard e-commerce data handled by Shopify. Before RestScan moves beyond pilots, Umay will update its privacy policy and add explicit camera consent flows. (See Appendix F.)</p>

<h2>8.3 Insurance</h2>
<p>Current: <strong>$2M CGL policy. Zero claims. Zero safety incidents</strong> across ~3,000 units shipped. Post-raise additions: D&amp;O, E&amp;O, and cyber liability. (See Appendix I.)</p>

<h2>8.4 Material Agreements</h2>
<p>Lean agreement footprint. All IP assigned to the company. No exclusivity traps. No change-of-control clauses. The biggest operational dependency is <strong>single-source manufacturing with Aztech &mdash;</strong> mitigated by Umay-owned tooling that is transferable. Tangent provides Gen 2 design engineering under full IP assignment. (See Appendix E.)</p>


<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<!-- 9. OPERATIONS AND EXECUTION -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>9. Operations and Execution Plan</h1>
<div class="purpose">What operational upgrades unlock the next phase of growth? US logistics, manufacturing scale, and Canadian cost advantages.</div>

<h2>9.1 US Logistics as a Growth Unlock</h2>
<p><strong>US 3PL is not a back-office project. It is prerequisite infrastructure</strong> for QR prescription drop-ship, 1099 rep scalability, and HSA/FSA-enabled checkout. Sea freight plus US fulfillment improves delivery speed, cuts per-unit costs, and eliminates cross-border duty friction. Timeline: vendor selection Q2 2026, go-live Q3 2026. (See Appendix D.)</p>

<h2>9.2 Manufacturing Readiness</h2>
<p>Aztech is the established manufacturing partner with capacity to scale. Gen 2 DFM work follows a standard <strong>EVT/DVT/PVT program</strong> managed through Tangent under IP assignment. Current <strong>COGS is $152 CAD all-in.</strong> Gen 2 DFM targets COGS compression to the $130&ndash;$120 range at higher volumes. (See Appendix E.)</p>

<h2>9.3 Canadian Advantage</h2>
<p>Canadian HQ provides concrete cost leverage: <strong>FX arbitrage</strong> (spend in CAD, sell into USD markets), <strong>SR&amp;ED tax credits</strong> (estimated ~$150K/year at 35% of qualifying R&amp;D spend), and <strong>NRC IRAP co-funding.</strong> A dual-entity structure (Canadian parent + Delaware C-Corp subsidiary) supports US investor expectations while preserving these advantages. (See Appendix C.)</p>

<!-- 10. TEAM SCALE PLAN -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>10. Team Scale Plan and Founder-to-Scale Transition</h1>
<div class="purpose">The company cannot grow past founder bandwidth. Here are the three hires that fix that, what they cost, and when they start.</div>

<p><strong>Post-raise hiring is minimal and leverage-driven: three hires remove the three biggest founder bottlenecks</strong> while keeping burn controlled.</p>

<h3>First three hires</h3>

<p><strong>Total incremental OpEx at full run-rate: ~$410K/year (~$34K/month).</strong> Burn steps up from current ~$28K/month to ~$62K/month by Q3 2026. Each hire is sequenced so the company never over-extends relative to capital deployed. (See Appendix N.)</p>

<h1>11. Capital Structure and Raise Context</h1>
<div class="purpose">What is the capital ask, how will it be deployed, and what does the investor get? Here are the numbers.</div>

<p>Founder-controlled cap table with 18 shareholders. <strong>Last priced round: December 2022 at $7.5M CAD pre-money.</strong> Founders hold ~69.8% pre-bridge. Current raise: <strong>$2M CAD on a rolling close basis,</strong> with valuation and instrument TBD. 10% ESOP planned. (See Appendix G.)</p>

<h2>11.1 Use of Funds</h2>

<h2>11.3 Debt and Runway</h2>
<p>With BDC retired (the locked strategy), monthly debt service drops from <strong>~$19.8K to ~$12.4K</strong> (PrairiesCan + CEBA only). Post-BDC monthly burn at current headcount: ~$28K. At full post-hire headcount: ~$62K. The financial model shows cash position, runway, and scenario analysis across bear/base/bull assumptions. (See Appendix G.)</p>
<p><strong>Debt profile:</strong> BDC $210K @ 10.55% (being retired, GSA on all assets). PrairiesCan $344K (amortizing). CEBA $56.7K (balloon December 2026). Debt service resumes April 2026 &mdash; capital is allocated to protect continuity through that cliff.</p>

<!-- 13. STRATEGIC OUTCOMES AND HORIZON PLANNING -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>13. Strategic Outcomes and Horizon Planning</h1>
<div class="purpose">What does success look like at each stage &mdash; and who would buy this company?</div>

<h2>13.1 Primary Outcome: Category-Leading Ocular Recovery Platform</h2>
<p>The primary goal is a <strong>defensible, category-leading ocular recovery company with durable reorder economics &mdash; independent of RestScan upside.</strong> Rest alone, with its clinic channel and adherence data, is a fundable, acquirable business.</p>

<h2>13.2 Secondary Outcome: Closed-Loop Measurement Expands the Moat</h2>
<p>RestScan strengthens clinician confidence, patient conversion, and adherence while building a paired dataset. It remains <strong>non-diagnostic to protect regulatory posture &mdash;</strong> a wellness measurement, not a medical device claim. (See Appendix O for platform architecture and staged deployment roadmap.)</p>

<h2>13.3 Horizon Outcome: Autonomic Recovery / Neuro-Ocular Health</h2>
<p>Broader autonomic recovery positioning is pursued <strong>only when evidence and adoption justify it.</strong> This is gated optionality, not dependency.</p>

<h2>13.4 Strategic Acquirer Landscape and Exit Framing</h2>
<p><strong>Umay&rsquo;s closed-loop architecture creates acquisition value that exceeds standalone revenue multiples.</strong> The DED device market is split between companies with treatment OR measurement &mdash; <strong>none have both in a single platform, and none have a take-home device with proven clinic reorder economics.</strong></p>

<h3>Primary acquirer universe</h3>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Acquirer</th><th>Strategic Fit</th><th>Relationship</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td class="metric">J&amp;J Vision</td><td>Acquired TearScience (LipiFlow). Umay fills the at-home gap.</td><td>Early relationship exists</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Alcon</td><td>iLux in-office device. Umay adds prescribed at-home + measurement.</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">EssilorLuxottica</td><td>World&rsquo;s largest optical co. Umay maps to existing wholesale distribution.</td><td>Early relationship exists</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">CooperVision</td><td>Growing DED interest via specialty lenses. Umay adds recovery + measurement.</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="metric">Bausch + Lomb</td><td>Broad eye care portfolio, no at-home device or closed-loop measurement.</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>The acquirer buys three things:</strong> (1) A proven clinic distribution channel with reorder economics. (2) A closed-loop IP portfolio protecting the detect &rarr; treat &rarr; measure loop. (3) The only N=500 government-backed clinical dataset for at-home thermal therapy. The financial model includes exit scenario tables at 3&times;, 5&times;, 8&times;, and 12&times; revenue multiples.</p>

<!-- 14. 12-18 MONTH ROADMAP -->
<!-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->
<h1>14. 12&ndash;18 Month Roadmap (Raise-Aligned)</h1>
<div class="purpose">What happens with the money, and when? A staged sequence: stabilize supply first, scale clinics second, expand DTC third, build RestScan in parallel.</div>

<p>Execution follows a deliberate sequence: <strong>stabilize supply and operational reliability &rarr; scale US clinic distribution &rarr; expand DTC as fulfillment proves out.</strong> RestScan remains a gated 12-month development program &mdash; an accelerator, not a dependency for Rest&rsquo;s standalone economics.</p>
