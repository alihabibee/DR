<p>Draft Master Strategy – February 24, 2026<br />
Clinically-Adjacent Ocular Recovery Platform Powered by Closed-Loop
Measurement<br />
Confidential — Data Room</p>
<h1 id="executive-summary">1. Executive Summary</h1>
<p>Umay has built the first at-home ocular recovery platform grounded in
optometric clinical insight and engineered therapeutic design. It is
co-founded by Ali Habib (engineering/product innovation) and Dr. Sharmin
Habib, OD (clinical direction and claims integrity). What makes Umay
unusual is the combination: a real clinical problem, a purpose-built
device that clinics already adopt and reorder, and the discipline to
scale without overclaiming. This document is the board-style strategy
for how Umay grows—patient by patient, clinic by clinic—while building
the foundation for a larger category over time.</p>
<p><strong>Traction to date (as of February 2026):</strong> ~3,000 units
shipped to 107 clinic partners (42 actively ordering), generating $1.5M+
in lifetime revenue. A 1,600-unit backlog ($456K+ wholesale value) sits
pre-ordered with deposits collected, constrained only by inventory
funding. The TTM revenue of $620K understates demand — it reflects a
supply constraint, not a market ceiling. When inventory is available,
the company has demonstrated a $300K single-quarter run rate. Clinic
reorder rate is ~60% within 3–6 months, and the return rate across all
units shipped is below 1%.</p>
<p>Invisible fatigue is the foundational demand driver: patients often
normalize ocular strain until it shows up downstream as poorer sleep,
reduced focus, and lower daily performance. Umay’s advantage is that
clinics can name the problem, prescribe a practical recovery ritual, and
see repeat purchase behavior as proof of economic and patient value.</p>
<p>Umay’s product strategy is conservative in claims and disciplined in
regulation. Rest is positioned as a consumer wellness product (Health
Canada consumer safety approved; IEC 60335-1 certified) with governed,
OD-approved language that protects future regulatory optionality (see
Appendix A for the claims ladder and gating system). In parallel, Umay
is developing RestScan—a browser-first, webcam-based ocular fatigue and
autonomic stress assessment tool that runs 100% locally (no video
stored; no facial identifiers transmitted), which adds measurement and
personalization without inheriting biometric data liabilities (see
Appendix F for the privacy architecture). RestScan is expected to be
clinic-ready approximately ~12 months post-close; it is a future
conversion and retention accelerant, not a prerequisite for near-term
scale.</p>
<p>Strategically, Umay sits in two categories—by design:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary category (today): Ocular Recovery Platform — a clinically
informed, at-home recovery system for dry eye symptoms, ocular fatigue,
and digital strain.</li>
<li>Architectural layer (next): Closed-loop therapeutic measurement
system — RestScan strengthens the prescription moment by adding an
objective wellness signal and a repeatable baseline, supporting
conversion and adherence once it is validated and clinic-ready (~12
months post-close). See Appendix O for the architecture/roadmap and
Appendix F for privacy-by-design constraints.</li>
<li>Strategic horizon (future): Autonomic Recovery / Neuro-Ocular Health
System — pursued only when evidence and adoption justify it, without
distracting from the core business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Roadmap: scale the clinic-led ocular recovery platform first;
introduce RestScan only after clinical validation; extend into autonomic
neuro-ocular health only when adoption and evidence justify category
expansion.</p>
<p>This master strategy is written for investors and for the leaders who
will join Umay post-raise. It is designed to be practical: it explains
what Umay will do first, what it will not do yet, and the controls that
keep the company investable as it scales. Where deeper evidence or
operating detail matters, the narrative points to the relevant appendix
and summarizes what it contains.</p>
<h1 id="strategic-thesis-and-category-positioning">2. Strategic Thesis
and Category Positioning</h1>
<p>Umay’s strategy starts with a simple institutional posture: build the
category from the most credible edge. For Umay, that edge is optometric
clinical authority—paired with a product innovation capability that has
already delivered a differentiated device into market. Umay is not
trying to “sell wellness into clinics.” It is exporting clinical
credibility into wellness—using clinics as the trust engine, then
expanding access as logistics and capacity mature. (See Appendix O for
the final category definition, strategic hierarchy, and the hybrid
framing: ocular recovery platform first, closed-loop measurement
second.)</p>
<p>A foundational strategic insight underpinning Umay’s positioning is
the concept of invisible ocular fatigue — a condition that patients
often cannot accurately perceive yet materially impacts sleep,
productivity, and long-term ocular health. Clinics are not simply
adopting a device; they are adopting a structured response to a problem
that has historically lacked measurable feedback. This insight informs
product design, clinical adoption behaviour, and long-term platform
expansion.</p>
<h2 id="category-framing-primary-architectural-layer">2.1 Category
framing (primary + architectural layer)</h2>
<p>Category clarity matters because it shapes how the opportunity is
evaluated. Umay should be understood first as an <strong>ocular recovery
platform</strong>—built with optometric clinical insight and engineered
therapeutic design—and second as a <strong>closed-loop measurement
architecture</strong> (RestScan) that will strengthen adherence, proof,
and personalization as it matures.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ocular Recovery Platform (primary):</strong> Umay Rest is an
at-home recovery system for ocular comfort and relaxation, aligned to
optometry’s daily reality: high prevalence of dry eye symptoms, fatigue
complaints, and digital strain. The product integrates into an existing
habit window (10 minutes before bed), producing high adherence and low
returns. (See Appendix K for channel economics, reorder mechanics, and
why clinics function as repeatable distribution nodes.)</li>
<li><strong>Closed-loop therapeutic system (architectural
layer):</strong> RestScan adds an objective measure at the start of the
care journey, turning a subjective recommendation into a data-driven
prescription moment—without claiming diagnosis. This strengthens
conversion, reinforces adherence, and creates a compounding data asset
over time. (See Appendix O for the platform architecture and roadmap
framing, including RestScan as a future measurement lever.)</li>
</ul>
<h2
id="tone-quietly-confident-clinically-grounded-strategically-ambitious">2.2
Tone: quietly confident, clinically grounded, strategically
ambitious</h2>
<p>Umay is positioned as clinically adjacent wellness: OD-led,
science-backed, and compliance-aware—with ambition expressed through
defensible execution (patents, clinic adoption, reorder behavior) rather
than hype. Rest is the proven core; RestScan is the measurement layer in
development that will tighten the loop over time, without being required
for near-term success. (See Appendix A for the claims governance ladder
and gate system that keeps this posture clean as we scale.)</p>
<h2 id="the-thesis-in-one-sentence">2.3 The thesis in one sentence</h2>
<p>Umay has built a clinically-adjacent ocular recovery platform that
clinics already reorder, and is layering in closed-loop measurement to
deepen conversion, adherence, and defensibility—while maintaining strict
claims discipline to preserve regulatory optionality.</p>
<h1 id="organizational-overview-and-governance-posture">3.
Organizational Overview and Governance Posture</h1>
<p>Umay is founder-led at an inflection point. The company’s current
traction (~3,000 units shipped, 107 clinic partners, $1.5M+ lifetime
revenue, government-backed pilot data) was achieved with 3 FTEs plus a
hardware engineering contractor. This capital efficiency is an asset,
but it also creates a single-point-of-failure risk: Ali currently spans
sales, manufacturing/ops, product execution, and fundraising. The
post-raise plan is the founder-to-scale transition: “Ali does the things
only Ali can do” (investors, partnerships, top accounts), while
repeatable functions become owned by dedicated leaders. (See Appendix B
for the current → post-raise org chart and reporting lines, and Appendix
N for the founder-to-scale operating model and why these hires de-risk
execution.)</p>
<h2
id="founder-dynamic-engineer-led-innovation-with-clinical-authority-embedded">3.1
Founder dynamic: engineer-led innovation with clinical authority
embedded</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ali Habib (CEO):</strong> leads product architecture and
commercial execution, and evolves into a strategic
operator—investor/partner-facing, category vision and key accounts—so
the company is not constrained by founder bandwidth.</li>
<li><strong>Dr. Sharmin Habib, OD (CMO):</strong> governs clinical
direction and claims integrity, anchors optometric credibility, and
protects regulatory posture through evidence discipline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The origin story is clinically driven, not technology-first: the
product was created to solve a real clinical gap in dry eye care, not to
“find a market for a gadget.” That same pattern continues with RestScan:
it exists because clinics lack an accessible, scalable way to objectify
ocular fatigue at the point of care. (See Appendix O for the
clinically-driven origin narrative and how it informs both Rest and
RestScan development.)</p>
<h2 id="governance-maturity-signal">3.2 Governance maturity signal</h2>
<p>Umay’s governance posture is intentionally institutional. Risks are
framed as systems and controls, not founder limitations. Claims
governance, privacy architecture, and regulatory pathway planning are
built into the operating model—not retrofits (see Appendix A for
claims/regulatory governance and Appendix F for privacy architecture and
roadmap). Post-raise, board-ready governance and D&amp;O insurance are
expected additions to match investor requirements (see Appendix I for
the insurance roadmap).</p>
<h1 id="market-and-industry-context">4. Market and Industry Context</h1>
<p>Umay’s core category sits inside ocular surface health and dry eye
symptoms — a market where clinical demand is high, patient adherence is
historically low, and the market lacks consumer-grade solutions that
patients actually use. The U.S. DED therapeutics market is $5.06B (2025)
growing at 8.39% CAGR; the Canadian DED market is $448M growing at 9.17%
CAGR — the fastest in North America. The treatment devices segment alone
is projected to grow from $124M (2024) to $261M (2034). The U.S.
societal burden of dry eye exceeds $59B annually ($4B direct medical
costs, $55B in productivity losses), with Canadian per-patient costs
averaging C$24,330/year (79% driven by presenteeism).</p>
<p>Clinics already invest in in-office procedures that can generate high
per-session revenue but require chair time, capital equipment, and staff
training. Umay complements these procedures as the at-home maintenance
layer: zero chair time, zero capital, and a simple prescription motion.
(See Appendix O for category framing and market context, and Appendix A
for the claims boundaries that keep the posture compliant.)</p>
<p>The go-to-market logic is straightforward: optometry clinics are
distribution nodes with repeated patient traffic. A single activated
clinic can repeatedly convert patients with minimal incremental cost,
producing recurring reorder patterns that look more like installed-base
retention than one-time hardware sales. (See Appendix K for how reorder
behavior converts clinic activity into an installed-base revenue
engine.)</p>
<h2
id="why-clinically-adjacent-wellness-is-the-correct-investor-category">4.1
Why ‘clinically-adjacent wellness’ is the correct investor category</h2>
<p>This positioning is not marketing — it is the operating posture that
protects trust with ODs, keeps claims disciplined, and lets Umay expand
distribution without inheriting regulatory debt.</p>
<p>Umay is not positioned as a consumer wellness gadget, a sleep
product, or a lifestyle performance brand. Instead, Umay leads with
clinical credibility and disciplined claims; sleep, fatigue, and
productivity remain downstream benefits. This prevents regulatory debt
while still supporting a large consumer narrative. (See Appendix A for
the claims ladder and prohibited-claim triggers that keep the posture
clean.)</p>
<h2 id="the-compliance-crisis-umay-addresses">4.2 The compliance crisis
Umay addresses</h2>
<p>The DED market’s structural weakness is adherence. Rx eye drop
adherence at correct frequency is 10.2%. Cyclosporine adherence (PDC
≥80%) is 5.9%. Lifitegrast adherence is 9.7%. Over 75% of patients
discontinue treatment within 90 days. At-home warm compress compliance
is below 50%. By contrast, Umay Rest daily usage in the
government-backed pilot (N=500) was 84% — an order-of-magnitude
improvement over existing standards. This adherence advantage is the
economic engine behind clinic reorder behavior: patients who actually
use a product generate the outcomes that give clinicians confidence to
prescribe again.</p>
<h1 id="customer-and-channel-insights">5. Customer and Channel
Insights</h1>
<h2 id="the-clinic-as-the-trust-engine">5.1 The clinic as the trust
engine</h2>
<p>The buyer in Umay’s primary channel is the clinic (OD + staff), but
the end-user is the patient. The clinic must believe three things to
prescribe repeatedly: (1) The motion is simple and does not consume
chair time. (2) The economics make sense relative to other clinic
revenue streams. (3) Patients actually use the product and report
benefits—creating clinician confidence.</p>
<p>Umay’s clinic motion is designed to meet these needs in under two
minutes of staff time with a zero-inventory option. (See Appendix K for
the clinic motion, scripts, and the operational design that keeps staff
time low.) Reorder behavior is the most honest composite metric: it
captures patient usage, clinic economics, and trust—all in one
observable action.</p>
<p><strong>Clinic economics context:</strong> Umay Rest wholesales at
$285 with clinic retail at $500–600 (43–52% margin), fitting within the
established contact-lens-to-eyewear markup range. DED-focused practices
achieve 4× industry average growth rates, with annual DED patient values
ranging from $1,700 to $5,300. Average practice revenue is ~$2.1M with
54% derived from product sales. Umay requires no capital equipment, no
consumables, and no chair time — adoption friction is dramatically lower
than in-office systems like LipiFlow ($30–50K console), TearCare
($15–25K console + $1,200/procedure consumable), or IPL ($80–150K+
equipment).</p>
<h2
id="patient-behavior-adherence-and-the-felt-experience-advantage">5.2
Patient behavior: adherence and the ‘felt experience’ advantage</h2>
<p>The retention engine is ultimately patient behavior. Traditional dry
eye modalities suffer from low adherence. Umay’s evidence to date
indicates unusually strong stickiness: daily usage reported at 84% in
the government-backed pilot (N=500), DAU/MAU ratio of 0.64 across 2,847
active IoT devices, and a return rate below 1% across ~3,000 units
shipped. The behavioral explanation matters: thermal therapy creates an
immediate sensory experience, integrates into a bedtime ritual, and
delivers dual motivation (eye comfort plus sleep-related benefits)
without requiring complex behavior change. (See Appendix K for reorder,
retention, and channel-health evidence.)</p>
<h2 id="human-narrative-layer-the-invisible-fatigue-problem">5.3 Human
Narrative Layer: The Invisible Fatigue Problem</h2>
<p>Ocular fatigue is often invisible to the patient until it
accumulates—people adapt, normalize discomfort, and keep performing.
That is why a clinic-anchored prescription moment matters: it gives
language to a silent problem, legitimizes the solution, and creates a
simple ritual patients will actually repeat.</p>
<h1 id="defensibility-and-competitive-moat">6. Defensibility and
Competitive Moat</h1>
<p>Umay’s moat is multi-layered. The strongest strategic moat is clinic
distribution with demonstrated reorder behavior—because it is the
compounding output of the other moat layers. (See Appendices C, D, and
E.)</p>
<h2 id="moat-layer-1-channel-trust-reorder-economics-primary-moat">6.1
Moat layer 1: channel trust + reorder economics (primary moat)</h2>
<p>A clinic that has prescribed Umay successfully to dozens of patients
has embedded the product into its standard of care. Switching costs are
practical and reputational: clinicians do not churn to unproven
alternatives when a product is already delivering patient satisfaction
and margin. Reorders also reduce dependency on proportional new-clinic
acquisition; growth becomes installed-base expansion.</p>
<p>Clinic reorder behaviour functions as more than a revenue signal; it
represents behavioural validation. Reorders indicate that Umay has
integrated into clinical workflow, demonstrated patient adherence, and
generated economic confidence for practitioners. Of Umay’s 42 actively
ordering clinics, ~8 Super-Clinics drive approximately 80% of volume,
each selling through 5–10 units per month — demonstrating the power law
distribution that characterizes successful clinic-dispensed product
platforms.</p>
<h2
id="moat-layer-2-closed-loop-measurement-as-a-conversion-and-data-amplifier">6.2
Moat layer 2: closed-loop measurement as a conversion and data
amplifier</h2>
<p>RestScan is the strategic amplifier once it is clinic-ready (~12
months post-close): it can move the recommendation from a subjective
complaint to an objective wellness signal at the start of the visit. The
core business does not depend on RestScan; it is designed to accelerate
conversion, adherence, and reorder once validated and deployed.</p>
<p>Closed-loop precedents validate this architecture: Medtronic’s
CGM+pump generates $2.76B in revenue with 80%+ recurring; Oura achieves
88% retention (vs. 25% industry baseline); ForeseeHome improved AMD
detection adherence from 62% to 94%. The universal pattern across
closed-loop health systems is a 1.5–3.5× retention improvement when the
measurement loop closes.</p>
<h2 id="moat-layer-3-ip-portfolio-and-trade-secrets">6.3 Moat layer 3:
IP portfolio and trade secrets</h2>
<p>Umay holds 3 issued U.S. utility patents (including a November 2025
grant for stress-sensing integration), 1 European patent, 4+ design
registrations, 5 trademarks, and provisional applications covering
RestScan and Thermal Rhythm technologies. All IP is assigned to the
company. (See Appendices H and L.)</p>
<h2 id="moat-layer-4-regulatory-cleanliness-as-strategic-leverage">6.4
Moat layer 4: regulatory cleanliness as strategic leverage</h2>
<p>Regulatory discipline is a moat because it preserves optionality.
Companies that overclaim early accumulate regulatory debt that becomes
expensive and irreversible. Umay’s tiered claims ladder, gate system,
and partner compliance provisions are designed to scale beyond founder
oversight without risking enforcement actions. (See Appendices A and
K.)</p>
<h1 id="revenue-engine-architecture">7. Revenue Engine Architecture</h1>
<p>Umay’s revenue engine is intentionally staged: clinic channel first,
then broader distribution as logistics and capacity mature.</p>
<h2 id="stage-1-clinic-led-growth-and-installed-base-expansion">7.1
Stage 1: clinic-led growth and installed-base expansion</h2>
<p>In the near term, the majority of growth is clinic-driven because it
matches Umay’s category positioning: clinical credibility first. Clinics
are efficient distribution nodes: one relationship can generate many
patient conversions.</p>
<p><strong>Current traction anchors:</strong> ~60% clinic reorder rate
within 3–6 months of first order, with active clinics selling through
~5–10 units per month. The 93.9% revenue retention from existing clinics
in 2025 demonstrates the durability of the installed base. Marginal
LTV:CAC is approximately 46× — reflecting the efficiency of a channel
where activation cost per clinic is ~$250 and total revenue LTV per
clinic exceeds $41,000 over a 2-year horizon with 8 expected reorder
cycles.</p>
<h2 id="motion-and-monetization-models">7.2 Motion and monetization
models</h2>
<p>Umay supports multiple clinic monetization paths: wholesale
stock-and-sell (43–52% clinic margin), zero-inventory QR prescription
flow (drop-ship), and in-office session billing where applicable. (See
Appendix K.)</p>
<h2
id="stage-2-parallel-dtc-once-logistics-meet-service-level-requirements">7.3
Stage 2: parallel DTC once logistics meet service-level
requirements</h2>
<p>DTC scales in parallel only after US logistics meet a clinic-grade
service level (delivery time, returns, and duty friction resolved). DTC
economics are modeled separately: higher ASP ($705 MSRP), different
return profile, direct-to-consumer marketing costs, and no clinic margin
share. DTC is not activated in the base financial scenario; it enters
the model as a gated toggle in the bull case. Clinics remain the primary
growth engine regardless of DTC timing.</p>
<h2 id="salesforce-architecture-head-of-growth-variable-cost-reps">7.4
Salesforce architecture: Head of Growth + variable-cost reps</h2>
<p>US expansion uses a managed 1099 rep network rather than prematurely
building a fixed-cost W-2 sales org. The Head of Growth role is
non-negotiable; reps do not replace it. (See Appendix K for the
commission model and rep economics.)</p>
<h1
id="institutional-readiness-regulatory-privacy-insurance-and-material-agreements">8.
Institutional Readiness: Regulatory, Privacy, Insurance, and Material
Agreements</h1>
<h2 id="regulatory-firewall-and-claims-governance">8.1 Regulatory
firewall and claims governance</h2>
<p>Umay’s claims governance is an operating system: four-tier claims
ladder, five-gate evidence graduation, and partner compliance language
that scales beyond founder oversight. (See Appendix A.)</p>
<h2 id="data-privacy-posture">8.2 Data privacy posture</h2>
<p>RestScan is architected privacy-first: processing is local in the
browser; no video is stored; no facial identifiers or landmarks are
transmitted. Before RestScan moves beyond pilots, Umay will update its
privacy policy and implement explicit camera consent flows. See Appendix
F.</p>
<h2 id="insurance-posture">8.3 Insurance posture</h2>
<p>Umay maintains a renewed $2M CGL policy with zero claims and zero
safety incidents across ~3,000 units shipped. Post-raise: D&amp;O,
E&amp;O, and cyber are recommended institutional layers. (See Appendix
I.)</p>
<h2 id="material-agreements-and-operational-dependencies">8.4 Material
agreements and operational dependencies</h2>
<p>Umay’s agreement footprint is lean, with IP assigned to the company
and no exclusivity traps. Single-source manufacturing (Aztech) is the
most material dependency; tooling is Umay-owned and transferable.
Tangent provides design engineering for Gen 2 DFM work under IP
assignment. (See Appendix E.)</p>
<h1 id="operations-and-execution-plan">9. Operations and Execution
Plan</h1>
<h2 id="us-logistics-as-a-growth-unlock">9.1 US logistics as a growth
unlock</h2>
<p>US 3PL is prerequisite infrastructure for QR prescription drop-ship,
1099 reps, and an HSA/FSA-enabled checkout motion. See Appendix D.</p>
<h2 id="manufacturing-readiness">9.2 Manufacturing readiness</h2>
<p>Aztech is the established manufacturing partner with capacity to
scale; Gen 2 DFM work is structured as an EVT/DVT/PVT program managed
through Tangent under IP assignment. Current COGS is $152 CAD all-in.
Gen 2 DFM targets COGS compression to the $130–120 range at higher
volumes. (See Appendix E.)</p>
<h2 id="capital-efficiency-and-canadian-advantage">9.3 Capital
efficiency and Canadian advantage</h2>
<p>Canadian HQ provides execution leverage via FX arbitrage, SR&amp;ED
credits (estimated ~$150K/year at 35% of qualifying R&amp;D spend), and
NRC IRAP co-funding. A dual-entity structure (Canadian parent + Delaware
C-Corp subsidiary) supports US investor expectations while preserving
Canadian R&amp;D advantages. (See Appendix C.)</p>
<h1 id="team-scale-plan-and-founder-to-scale-transition">10. Team Scale
Plan and Founder-to-Scale Transition</h1>
<p>Post-raise hiring is intentionally minimal and leverage-driven: three
core hires remove founder bottlenecks while keeping burn controlled.
(See Appendix N.)</p>
<h2 id="first-three-hires-and-sequencing">10.1 First three hires and
sequencing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Head of Growth (US) — unlocks US channel and rep network. Target:
~$150K/year. Phased in Q2 2026.</li>
<li>Product/Tech Lead — owns Gen 2 + RestScan + Tangent relationship.
Target: ~$160K/year. Phased in Q3 2026.</li>
<li>Operations Manager — owns supply, 3PL, inventory, and fulfillment.
Target: ~$100K/year. Phased in Q2–Q3 2026.</li>
</ul>
<p>Total incremental OpEx at full run-rate: ~$410K/year (~$34K/month).
Burn steps up from current ~$28K/month to ~$62K/month by Q3 2026.</p>
<h1 id="capital-structure-and-raise-context">11. Capital Structure and
Raise Context</h1>
<p>Founder-controlled cap table with 18 shareholders; last priced round
December 2022 at $7.5M CAD pre-money. Current raise is $2M CAD on a
rolling close basis, with valuation/instrument TBD. 10% ESOP planned.
(See Appendix G.)</p>
<h2 id="use-of-funds">11.1 Use of funds</h2>
<p>The $2M deployment is structured to unlock sequential growth
gates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inventory and backlog fulfillment (~$500K):</strong> Clear
the 1,600-unit backlog, fund PO2 and PO3 production runs. This is the
single highest-ROI allocation — it converts $456K+ in pre-ordered
revenue and eliminates the supply constraint.</li>
<li><strong>BDC debt retirement (~$270K):</strong> Eliminates the $210K
BDC loan plus accumulated interest. Removes $6,800/month payment,
eliminates GSA seizure risk, extends runway by ~4 months. Net cost after
saved payments is ~$138K.</li>
<li><strong>RestScan R&amp;D (~$200K):</strong> Funds the 12-month
validation program from POC to clinic-ready.</li>
<li><strong>US sales activation (~$150K):</strong> Head of Growth hire,
initial 1099 rep recruitment, 2 optometry conference appearances, and
TrueMed HSA/FSA integration.</li>
<li><strong>Working capital and runway (~$880K):</strong> Remaining
hires, general operations, and cash buffer to maintain 12+ months of
runway at post-hire burn rate.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="unit-economics-summary">11.2 Unit economics summary</h2>
<p>Wholesale price: $285 CAD. Landed COGS: $152 CAD. Gross margin:
46.7%. Clinic LTV (revenue basis, 8 reorder cycles): ~$42,000. Marginal
CAC per clinic: ~$250. LTV:CAC on marginal basis: ~46×.</p>
<h2 id="debt-and-runway">11.3 Debt and runway</h2>
<p>With BDC retirement (the locked strategy), monthly debt service drops
from ~$19.8K to ~$12.4K (PrairiesCan + CEBA only). Post-BDC-retirement
monthly burn at current headcount is ~$28K; at full post-hire headcount,
~$62K. The financial model shows cash position, runway, and scenario
analysis across bear/base/bull assumptions. (See Appendix G.)</p>
<h1 id="strategic-risk-framework">12. Strategic Risk Framework</h1>
<p>Risks are framed as managed systems with mitigations embedded in the
operating plan.</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply/stockout risk → safety stock, PO cadence, 3PL transition.
(See Appendices E and D.)</li>
<li>Clinic concentration risk → activation of dormant clinics (65 in
network but not actively ordering) + US expansion. (See Appendix
K.)</li>
<li>Founder-dependency risk → three-hire plan + reporting lines. (See
Appendix N.)</li>
<li>Regulatory/claims risk → claims ladder, gates, partner training.
(See Appendices A and K.)</li>
<li>Privacy/cyber risk → local-only architecture + policy/processors.
(See Appendix F.)</li>
<li>Working capital timing → PO deposit cadence and backlog AR
management. (See Appendix G.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="strategic-outcomes-and-horizon-planning">13. Strategic Outcomes
and Horizon Planning</h1>
<h2 id="primary-outcome-category-leading-ocular-recovery-platform">13.1
Primary outcome: category-leading ocular recovery platform</h2>
<p>Primary outcome is a defensible, category-leading ocular recovery
company with durable reorder economics, independent of RestScan
upside.</p>
<h2
id="secondary-outcome-closed-loop-measurement-expands-conversion-and-defensibility">13.2
Secondary outcome: closed-loop measurement expands conversion and
defensibility</h2>
<p>RestScan strengthens clinician confidence, patient conversion, and
adherence while building a paired dataset.</p>
<h2
id="horizon-outcome-autonomic-recovery-neuro-ocular-health-system">13.3
Horizon outcome: autonomic recovery / neuro-ocular health system</h2>
<p>Broader autonomic recovery positioning is pursued only when evidence
and adoption justify it.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-acquirer-landscape-and-exit-framing">13.4 Strategic
acquirer landscape and exit framing</h2>
<p>Umay’s closed-loop architecture (Rest therapeutic + RestScan
measurement) creates strategic acquisition value that exceeds standalone
revenue multiples. The DED device market is dominated by companies that
have either treatment or measurement — none have both in a single
platform, and none have a take-home device with proven clinic reorder
economics.</p>
<p><strong>Primary strategic acquirer universe:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>J&amp;J Vision:</strong> Acquired TearScience (LipiFlow) for
the in-office DED treatment market. Umay fills J&amp;J’s gap: a
take-home maintenance layer. Early relationship exists.</li>
<li><strong>Alcon:</strong> iLux in-office device with strong optometry
distribution. Umay would add a prescribed at-home complement and
RestScan measurement capability.</li>
<li><strong>EssilorLuxottica:</strong> The world’s largest optical
company with wholesale ophthalmic distribution infrastructure. Umay’s
clinic channel model maps directly to their existing relationships.
Early relationship exists.</li>
<li><strong>CooperVision:</strong> Growing DED interest through
specialty contact lens positioning. Umay adds a therapeutic recovery
layer and measurement capability.</li>
<li><strong>Bausch + Lomb:</strong> Broad eye care portfolio with DED
products but no prescribed at-home device or closed-loop
measurement.</li>
<li><strong>Digital health platforms:</strong> Companies building ocular
health or sleep health platforms may value the RestScan IP and clinical
data asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Acquisition thesis:</strong> The acquirer buys three things —
a proven clinic distribution channel with reorder economics, a
closed-loop IP portfolio that protects the detect → treat → measure
loop, and the only N=500 government-backed clinical dataset for at-home
thermal therapy.</p>
<p>The financial model includes an exit scenario table showing MOIC at
3×, 5×, 8×, and 12× revenue multiples and a channel value analysis
estimating implied acquisition price through acquirer distribution
modeling.</p>
